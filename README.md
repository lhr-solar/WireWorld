### Setting up Git
If you don't see yourself viewing any boards then download GitHub Desktop (https://desktop.github.com/) :vomiting_face:  
If you see will be using Git for anything else (ie youâ€™re a part of Wire Harnessing or Enclosures) then follow these guides for setting up SSH :sunglasses::

### Cloning the Repo :cyclone:
When you clone the repo you need to make sure that you're putting the folder somewhere that's easily accessible to you and somewhere that makes sense.
There are 2 ways to do this:
1. Use the ```cd``` command to navigate to your goal location. (information on how to use this command is in the ``Useful Commands`` secton)
2. (Windows only) Nvigate to where you want to clone the repo in File Explorer
right click empty space -> Show more options -> Start Git Bash

Once you've entered your cloning designation or choice, run the command ```git clone```
The repository should now be copied into your folder ðŸ¥³  
Make sure to cd into your repository right after since when you clone a repo your computer wonâ€™t put you into that directory  
NOTE: When cloning board repositories youâ€™ll run ```git clone â€”recursive``` which will clone the submodule repository used to store the common KiCAD symbols and 3D models for their boards. Since as of 2023 this repo doesnâ€™t use any submodule repositories you donâ€™t need to add the recursive part, you can if youâ€™d like.

## Useful Commands :exclamation:
1. ```cd``` is a command used to navigate between directories on your computer. The way you use it is you type ```cd [file directory]``` for example if Iâ€™m in my Documents folder and want to enter my LHR folder Iâ€™ll run ```cd LHR``` and Iâ€™ll be placed into my LHR folder. Something to else to keep in mind is that when you open your terminal or Git Bash you may be in your most root directory so youâ€™ll need to navigate from your root to what folder you want. For example, if Iâ€™m in my root directory Iâ€™ll go ```cd Documents/LHR/WireWorld``` to navigate to my WireWorld folder. Pressing tab will autofill directories. Doing ```cd ..``` will go back one directory.
2. ```ls``` is a command that will display all files inside a directory.
3. ```ctrl + c``` doesn't work for copying in terminal, you need to use ```ctrl + ins```
4. ```ctrl + v``` doesn't work for pasting in terminal, you need to use ```shift + ins```
5. ```git branch``` this command will print which branch you are on
6. ```git checkout``` will switch which branch you're on. The way you use it is you do ```git checkout [branch name]``` if you are making a new branch do ```git checkout -b [new branch name]``` 
When you a push a new branch to the repo you need to do ```git push --set-upstream origin [branch name]```
7. ```git pull``` will pull changes from the remote repository to your local folder


## Pushing to this repository :computer:
Make sure youâ€™re not pushing to main, you should only be pushing to main though a Pull Request
1. Make sure youâ€™re cdâ€™d into your repository
2. Run ```git pull``` so youâ€™re up to date with any other changes
3. RunÂ Â ```git status``` to check which files are different on your local folder from the repo
4. Run ```git add [file you want to push]``` if you want to push all your files run ```git add .```
5. Run ```git commit -m [a commit message that describes the changes youâ€™ve made]```
6. Run ```git push```
Only files that you did ```git add``` for will be pushed to the remote repository
7. Revel in how cool you feel :sunglasses: rn

## Common Problems :construction_worker:
1. You're trying to switch branches but git is telling you that there are local changes and you need to commit or stash them. This means you've changed someonething on your branch. If you don't want to commit your changes run ```git stash```
2. Whoops, when you branched off you accidently changed a file that you didn't want to change, now you need to get a specific file from a different branch. Do ```git checkout [branch you want to checkout from] -- [file directory of path you want to check out (relative to your cloned folder)]```


## Wiring Diagram Formatting
For the sake of :sparkles:	aesthetic :sparkles: we want to keep all wiring diagrams in the same formatting including: colors, sizing, wire thickness, and any descriptions. Note we work in dark mode because dark mode is cool.
- Colors:
    1. For PWR wires: #FF0000
    2. For GND wires: #F0F0F0
    3. For CAN wires: #2D7600
    4. For Ethernet wires: #6C8EBF
    5. For IsoSPI wires: #006EAF
- Wire thickness:
    1. HV wire thickness should be larger than the LV and signal wire thickness to indicate a difference in AWG and voltage
- Board formatting:
    1. Boards should have a board name + board dimensions (in mm) 
    2. The thickness of the box should be around 6 pt for extra readability
    3. Rounded corners are great
    4. When there is a connector try to use the exact name label that is used on the actual boad, also put down the connector number (Usually it'll start with a J)
- Legend
    1. Always have a legend section where you can talk about what components are in your diagram
- Misc formatting:
    1. Indicate the area around an enclosure with non-filled 7 pt dashed line
    2. Wire text font size is usually 30 pt, but for any HV or large bundles of wires, the standard is 50 pt

## Generator script
This script allows us to combine various xml or .drawio files into one single .drawio file.  
To export your sheets go into the Master_diagram.drawio file and do File -> Export As -> Uncheck 'All pages' -> Export this will export the sheet you're currently on as a .xml file. Make sure to save it into the 'diagrams' folder.  
The script works by deleting the old Master_diagram.drawio file, going through the diagrams folder and merging every file that ends in .drawio or .xml, and exports that as Master_diagram.drawio. This means that any xml sheet not in the diagrams folder will not be represented in the new Master_diagram.drawio and your old changes will be gone.  
To use the generator script, simply call `python diagram_generator.py`. This will combine the various xml files representing sub-diagrams into one large XML file which can be opened as a draw.io notebook. Ensure that you have Python installed.  

## Making a Pull Request
In order to push to main you need to make a pull request where people can review your changes and make any modifications if needed before the changes are introduced into main. PRs also don't have to just to be main, you could be merging your changes to a different branch.
1. In the browser version of GitHub, go to the Pull Requests tab -> New Pull Request
2. Figure out which branches you want to merge to
3. Add a comment explaining your changes
4. Add reviewers for your changes (currnet reviewers can be seen below)
5. Resolve any merge conflicts
6. Once your PR is approved by your reviewers you or they can merge the request
7. Make sure to press the drop down in "Merge Pull Request" and do "Squash and Merge" which will also move your commit history to the branch you're merging to
6. ??
7. Profit :moneybag:
